# User Story: User Authentication and Session Management

Implement user authentication and session management for a Node.js Express application with MongoDB as the primary database and Redis for caching, to ensure secure access to the application and optimize performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### [1]. User Registration
- **As a new user**, I want to register with:
    - A unique username.
    - A valid email address.
    - A secure password.
- Passwords should be securely hashed and stored in MongoDB.
- User information should include at least:
    - Username.
    - Email.
    - Hashed password.

### 2. User Login
- **As a registered user**, I want to log in using my username and password.
- The system should:
    - Verify the provided credentials against the stored hashed passwords in MongoDB.
    - Establish a secure session upon successful login.

### 3. Session Management
- **As a user with an active session**, I want my session to be:
    - Securely stored and managed.
    - Stored in Redis with session expiration management.
- Sessions should:
    - Be invalidated after a specified period of inactivity.
    - Allow users to log out, destroying their session.

### 4. Access Control
- **As an authenticated user**, I want access to resources and functionalities requiring authentication.
- The system should:
    - Implement middleware to protect routes requiring authentication.
    - Redirect unauthorized access attempts to the login page.

### 5. Password Reset
- **As a user who forgot the password**, I want to initiate a password reset.
- The system should:
    - Implement a secure password reset mechanism.
    - Send a time-limited token via email.
    - Store the token securely and use it to verify the user's identity during the password reset process.

### 6. Security Measures
- **As a user**, I want the application to follow best security practices:
    - Implement secure password hashing using a proven algorithm.
    - Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
    - Sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

### 7. Logging
- **As a developer**, I want to track and monitor user authentication and session-related activities.
- The system should:
    - Use a logging library to log important events and errors related to authentication and session management.

### 8. Testing
- **As a developer**, I want to ensure the reliability of the implemented features through testing.
- The system should:
    - Include comprehensive unit and integration test cases.
    - Cover user registration, login, session management, and other related functionalities.
